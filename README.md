# About Me

I work at the intersection of **Machine Learning systems and applied AI**, with a strong focus on understanding models beyond surface-level abstractions. I am currently a **Data Engineer Intern**, gaining hands-on experience with cloud data architectures, scalable pipelines, and distributed systems, while actively building and studying **deep learning and large language models from first principles**.

My recent work includes implementing **Transformer-based language models from scratch**, developing **real-time computer vision systems**, and designing **end-to-end ML pipelines** that balance theoretical rigor with practical constraints. I am particularly interested in **LLMs, attention-based architectures, multimodal systems, and model interpretability**, and in how these models behave, scale, and can be responsibly controlled.

I believe strong AI systems are built by engineers who understand both the **math and the machinery** behind them. I learn by building, debugging, and iterating—preferring clarity and depth over black-box usage.
