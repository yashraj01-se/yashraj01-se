## About Me

I work at the intersection of Machine Learning systems and applied AI, with a strong focus on understanding models beyond surface-level abstractions. I am currently a Data Engineer Intern, gaining hands-on experience with cloud data architectures, scalable pipelines, and distributed systems, while actively building and studying deep learning and large language models from first principles.

My recent work includes implementing Transformer-based language models from scratch, developing real-time computer vision systems, and designing end-to-end ML pipelines that balance theoretical rigor with practical constraints. I am particularly interested in LLMs, attention-based architectures, multimodal systems, and model interpretability, and in how these models behave, scale, and can be responsibly controlled.

I believe strong AI systems are built by engineers who understand both the math and the machinery behind them. I learn by building, debugging, and iterating—preferring clarity and depth over black-box usage.
