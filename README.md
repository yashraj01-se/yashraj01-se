##  About Me
I design and build AI systems from first principles, with a focus on rigorous understanding and practical scalability.

My work operates at the intersection of Deep Learning, Large Language Models, Computer Vision, and ML Systems Engineering. I am particularly interested in understanding not only model performance, but the underlying learning dynamics, optimization behavior, and scaling characteristics that govern how these systems function in real-world environments.

Currently serving as a Data Engineer Intern, I contribute to the design of scalable data infrastructure while actively developing and analyzing neural architectures and production-grade ML systems. My approach emphasizes strong mathematical foundations, careful experimentation, and systems-level thinking.

I prioritize hands-on implementation — building models from scratch, studying gradient flow and activation behavior, debugging training instabilities, and constructing end-to-end ML pipelines that bridge theory and deployment.
